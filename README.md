Real-Time Unauthorized Construction Detection and Area Assessment Using Drones
Overview
This project leverages cutting-edge Mask R-CNN for segmenting unauthorized construction areas from drone-captured images and calculating their areas using Geospatial Data Integration (GDI) techniques. Additionally, Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors are utilized in a second phase to assess depth and validate volumetric details.

How It Works
1. Detection and Segmentation Using Mask R-CNN
Mask R-CNN Architecture:
The Mask R-CNN model is trained on a custom dataset of drone images to accurately segment areas of unauthorized construction.

Input: Drone images captured in real-time.
Output: Binary masks highlighting the segmented construction areas.
Steps for Area Detection:

The segmented regions are extracted as binary masks.
These masks are overlaid on georeferenced maps to associate the segmented regions with spatial coordinates.
Using Geospatial Data Integration (GDI) tools, the pixel area of the mask is converted into real-world units (e.g., square meters).

2. Validation with Time-of-Flight (ToF) Sensors
ToF Sensor Integration:
ToF sensors are deployed to measure the depth of structures and estimate volumetric details.
Depth Calculation: Provides an additional dimension of analysis by measuring the height of unauthorized structures.
This validation step ensures accuracy in detecting discrepancies between approved and unauthorized construction volumes.
